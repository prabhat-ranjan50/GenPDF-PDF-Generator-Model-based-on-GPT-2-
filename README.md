# GenPDF-PDF-Generator-Model-based-on-GPT-2-
The GenPDF model introduces a novel paradigm by combining GPT-2 as the  'Article Generator' and a pre-trained Summarizer as the 'Summary Generator.' 

The GenPDF project represents a pioneering fusion of advanced Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, curated datasets, and innovative 
document generation strategies. Over the course of its one-year journey, the 
project has evolved into a dynamic and intelligent system for generating Portable 
Document Format (PDF) files based on user-provided keywords. 

The foundation of GenPDF lies in the curation of a diverse and comprehensive 
dataset sourced from reputable materials on operating systems. This curated 
corpus ensures not only relevance but also depth in understanding, setting the 
stage for effective training of the GPT-2 model—a state-of-the-art transformer
based NLP model developed by OpenAI. 

The training process employs reinforcement learning, fine-tuning GPT-2 on the 
intricacies of operating systems to generate coherent and contextually rich 
content. Through data augmentation strategies, the dataset's diversity is enhanced, 
enabling the model to generalize effectively across a spectrum of topics. 
The GenPDF model introduces a novel paradigm by combining GPT-2 as the 
'Article Generator' and a pre-trained Summarizer as the 'Summary Generator.' 
Operating in two distinct phases—Training and Working—the model seamlessly 
generates informative articles based on user-provided keywords. These articles 
are succinctly summarized, and the outputs from both generators are merged to 
create intelligently crafted PDF documents.
